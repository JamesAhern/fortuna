h1. wxfz's fortuna

My implementation of Fortuna ("See Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna_(PRNG) ) uses
64-pools of entropy gathered from the browser's clock, mouse position and DOM
content. Entropy is gathered also collected at random intervals and from mouse
movement. There is of course a lot of SHA256 and AES gnashing in the background.

Documentation is scant at this time, so drop me any questions at my GitHub
inbox.

This Fortuna was written to supply randomness to an All-Or-Nothing Transform library
to be used in some of my other projects.
